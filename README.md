Using machine learning techniques, this project analyzes border crossing data to forecast traffic volumes. By leveraging Random Forest regression and geographic data, the project aims to enhance resource allocation and planning through insightful model predictions.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict border crossing volumes using a Random Forest regression model based on geographic and categorical data. The analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing resource allocation and operational planning at border crossings.

Data Source
The data used in this project is publicly available and includes information on border crossing entries. The dataset contains features such as the port name, state, border, date, measure, value, and location coordinates.

Results
The Random Forest regression model was trained and evaluated on the border crossing data.
Key performance metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.
Visualizations were generated to illustrate the predictions and insights derived from the model.
